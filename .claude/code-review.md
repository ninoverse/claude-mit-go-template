# Code Review Guidelines

## What to check

### Lint and format
- `make fmt-check` is clean — no `gofmt`/`goimports` drift.
- `make vet` and `make lint` pass, with zero `//nolint:...` directives added
  without a justifying comment.

### Error handling
- Every returned `error` is checked (enforced by `errcheck`) — no ignored
  errors via `_ =` in non-test code paths. Test code is exempt.
- Wrap errors with context as they propagate: `fmt.Errorf("doing x: %w", err)`
  preserves the chain for `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
- No `panic` in normal control flow; reserve it for truly unrecoverable
  programmer errors. Prefer sentinel errors (`var ErrNotFound = errors.New(...)`)
  or typed errors (`type ValidationError struct{...}`) over string matching.

### Avoid unsafe escapes
- Avoid `unsafe` and reflection (`reflect`) unless there is no safe alternative;
  if used, justify it in one line in the PR description.
- Lean on `go vet` and the race detector (`-race`) rather than hand-rolled
  guarantees. Guard shared state with the `sync` primitives or channels.

### Public API
- Every exported identifier (`func`, `type`, `const`, `var`) has a doc comment
  that starts with the identifier's own name (`// FindByID returns …`).
- Each package has a package comment (`// Package store …`), in `doc.go` or atop
  the primary file.
- Public behavior has a runnable `Example` function (with an `// Output:` block)
  unless it is trivially obvious from the signature.

### Dependencies
- New dependencies have a one-line justification in the PR description.
- `make vuln` reports no known, reachable vulnerabilities.
- `make licenses` passes — no forbidden licenses. Module integrity is guaranteed
  by `go.sum` + the checksum database (`GOSUMDB`).
- The `go` directive in `go.mod` is not raised unless the change explicitly
  intends to. Raising it means editing `go.mod`, `.go-version`, the `Dockerfile`
  and the `go-version` input in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` together — a PR that
  moves some of those and not the rest goes red on the floor job.

### Tests
- New behavior is covered by at least one test (table-driven where it fits).
- `make test-race` passes.
